How’s it going? Hope you’re having a great day 😊 My name’s Andi, I’m a senior full-stack engineer, specialising in the frontend, from [Chepstow](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Chepstow) in [South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/South_Wales). My biggest passion in coding is creating the best [user experience](https://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/User_experience) possible — which is why I tend to lean towards the frontend — and am always working on random [personal projects](#current-active-projects-) outside of my day job. I’d like to start contributing more to the open source community too, aside from my own projects, as my biggest bragging right to date is a [PR](https://www.github.com/facebook/react/pull/11599) accepted to the main [React](https://www.github.com/facebook/react) repo… It’s only a config change, but I’m still counting it, damnit! 😂

## Current active projects 👩‍💻

🎮 **[Pokémon RBY DX](https://www.github.com/AmateurPanda92/pokemon-rby-dx)** — _my newest major venture, although we’re mostly just in the early stages of planning and asset design at the moment. It’s an ambitious set of ROM hacks that alter the disassembled original Pokémon Game Boy games to add full GBC colour and other features. Me and a fledgeling game designer friend started this recently as a collaboration project and would welcome contributions from others._

🚗 **[TriumphMayflowerClub.com](https://www.github.com/Stack-in-a-box/triumphmayflowerclub.com)** — _ongoing, long-term project, a website for a classic car club that I designed and developed from scratch, using Jekyll as a static site generator and then vanilla HTML, CSS, and a teeny bit of JS. I now maintain it by adding content and features. I plan to eventually develop a simple, bespoke CMS to allow non-technical members to author content like news articles. Actively looking for project co-maintainers and contributors by the way!_

🌟 **[Next.js Rewrite of the TMC Website](https://www.github.com/andiemmadavieswilcox/triumphmayflowerclub.com-next.js)** — _I’ve started work on the v2.0 rewrite of the TMC website, building it using Next.js (built on top of React), TypeScript, and Sass. When this SPA reaches parity with the current Jekyll-based website, we will switch over to using this one. The objective is to enable the addition of more advanced features that are currently impossible (or at least impractical to implement) with a static website._

🎨 **[CCC ’Cons](https://www.github.com/Stack-in-a-box/ccc-cons)** — _An acronym-ish of “Colour-restored Creative Cloud Icons”, this project is a quick icon pack I recently threw together than can be used to replace the terrible new (late-2020+) Adobe Creative Cloud icons (where some boneheaded designer decided to ditch the universally recognised individual app colours for dull, supposed category-grouped colours) with ones that use the same new icon style but with their colours restored to their pre-2020 glory, making them much more distinguishable and aesthetically pleasing again._

🌐 **[Chrome Domain Watermarker](https://www.github.com/Stack-in-a-box/chrome-domain-watermarker)** — _I haven’t worked on this in a few years, but that’s mostly down to getting distracted by other projects. This is a Chrome extension which allows users to display watermark text over user-specified domains, which can be useful for devs to remind themselves when they’re interacting with a production system rather than a staging one. It’s in a usable alpha state though, so please feel free to try it out and give feedback; I definitely want to revisit this in the near future._
